# Tactable Coding Challenge

This project is a potential solution to the Tactable.io coding challenge that assesses the use of Clean Architecture practices using DI.
The solution implements the DIC technique which is used to dynamically and declaritively handle the service/class dependency.
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/aasherkataria/tactableCodingChallenge.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd backend
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Since there is no server instance, we can run a jest test to simulate HTTP requests

```bash
  npm test
```
